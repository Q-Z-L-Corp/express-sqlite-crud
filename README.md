# Express CRUD API with SQLite

This repository contains a simple RESTful API built with **Express.js** and **SQLite** for performing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The project demonstrates how to set up an Express server and interact with an SQLite database using an ORM or raw SQL queries.

## Features:
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js framework for building APIs.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight, serverless database for storing and managing data.
- **CRUD Operations**: Endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.
- **RESTful API**: Follow standard REST principles for easy integration with front-end applications.
- **Data Validation**: Basic request validation using middleware.
- **Modular Design**: Separation of concerns between routes, controllers, and models for scalability.

## Endpoints:
- `GET /items`: Fetch all items from the database.
- `GET /items/:id`: Fetch a single item by its ID.
- `POST /items`: Create a new item.
- `PUT /items/:id`: Update an existing item by its ID.
- `DELETE /items/:id`: Delete an item by its ID.

## Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/express-sqlite-crud.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Dependencies:
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **SQLite3**: Database engine for data persistence.
- **Body-parser**: Middleware to parse incoming request bodies.
- **Dotenv**: Load environment variables from a `.env` file.

## Future Enhancements:
- Add **authentication** and **authorization** using JWT.
- Implement **pagination** for large datasets.
- Add **unit tests** using a testing framework like **Jest** or **Mocha**.
- Improve error handling and logging.
